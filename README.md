# Console-chat-app

This project is a simple console-based chat application written in C++ using Socket Programming. It allows multiple users to connect to a single chat room on a local network, where they can send messages to each other in real-time. The application has both an Admin mode, which creates and manages the chat group, and a User mode, where clients can join the group to chat.

This application is written entirely in C++ using Multithreading and built just for Windows OS using winsock API.

Steps to start the app:-
1. Run the main.cpp file.
2. Enter 1 to become Admin and enter IP Address(of Admin) and Port number to start the group chat.
3. Users must enter 2 and specify the IP Address(of Admin) and Port number to enter the group chat.
